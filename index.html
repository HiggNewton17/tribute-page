      <p>General James Harold “Jimmy” Doolittle (1896-1993) was a pioneering pilot, aeronautical engineer, combat leader and
        military strategist whose career stretched from World War I to the height of the Cold War. He is most famous for
        leading a daring bombing raid over Tokyo in 1942, the first American attack on the Japanese mainland. Doolittle’s
        16 planes dropped their bombs and then, lacking fuel to return to their carrier, flew on to crash-land in China and
        the Soviet Union.</p>

      <p> James Harold “Jimmy” Doolittle was born in Alameda, California, but spent much of his childhood in western Alaska.
        His father, Frank, was a gold prospector and carpenter in Nome, where young Jimmy learned to fight bullies and pilot
        a dogsled. Eventually Rosa and Jimmy Doolittle returned to California, leaving Frank behind. Did You Know? To aid
        his record-breaking 1922 coast-to-coast flight, U.S. military strategist Jimmy Doolittle invented a funnel-and-tube-based
        "pilot dehydrator"—possibly the earliest airplane toilet. Jimmy attended high school in Los Angeles, where he distinguished
        himself as a gymnast and boxer. He then began courses at the University of California at Berkeley’s School of Mines.</p>

      <p> Returning to the army full-time in 1940, Doolittle continued his test pilot work until January of 1942, when he was
        summoned by General Henry H. “Hap” Arnold to lead a raid on the Japanese mainland. At the time Japan’s defensive
        perimeter in the Pacific was wide enough to make it invulnerable to conventional carrier-based attacks. Sixteen Army
        B-25 bombers were rigged with doubled fuel capacity and loaded on the aircraft carrier USS Hornet. The original plan
        called for bombing five major cities, but last-minute detection of the Hornet forced the planes to launch a day early.
        With Doolittle in the lead, the planes survived storms and anti-aircraft fire to drop four bombs each on Tokyo, striking
        industrial facilities and a light cruiser. Several bombs hit civilian areas, killing 50 and injuring 400. The Doolittle
        Raiders, as the planes’ pilots became known, flew on toward China. They had planned to land in areas controlled by
        Chinese Nationalists, but all ran out of fuel and crashed. Most of the crews parachuted to the ground, where with
        local help they were able to reach the Nationalist lines. One crew landed in Vladivostok and was interned by the
        Soviets. Three died in the crashes, and eight were captured by the Japanese.
